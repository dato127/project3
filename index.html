    <P><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy <u>text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry.</P>
    <p><i><b>Lorem Ipsum</b>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s,</mark> when
         an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</i></p>
    <p>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset
         sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
          like <s>AldusPageMaker</s> including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
